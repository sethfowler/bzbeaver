An alternate Bugzilla interface designed for maximum productivity.

This is a very alpha project, but it's reached the point where it's usable for
the determined. Currently it provides a dashboard that summarizes your
`needinfo`s, review requests, feedback requests, and assigned bugs in a
convenient manner, with helpful features like notification of new comments.
